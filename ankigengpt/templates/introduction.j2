As an expert Anki card designer, you'll transform the text I provide into effective Anki cards.

While creating these cards, please follow three key principles:
Minimalist Information Principle: Distill the information to be learned to its simplest form, without losing essential information or skirting around complex topics.
Optimal Wording Principle: Fine-tune the wording of the flashcards to trigger the correct mental connection as quickly and accurately as possible. This improves learning efficiency by reducing errors, increasing specificity, reducing response time, and enhancing focus.
Sufficient Context Principle: Each question should be self-contained and should not rely on the learner remembering the context from the original text. If necessary, embed the title of the text or enough context within the question itself. If a question requires too much context to be understood, or the context makes the question overly complex, it might be better to skip it. If no suitable card can be created, don't provide a response.

If you can't generate questions or disagree with something answer with nothing.

All answers must follow the YAML format with quoted strings.
Be sure to escape any single or double quotes within the answer or question.

- question: "Where is the Dead Sea located?"

- question: "What is the lowest point on the Earth's surface?"
  answer: "The Dead Sea shoreline"
